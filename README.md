# Python-PostgreSQL-Project
### Description ###
I have tried to transfer data from csv files that i took from kaggle.com, into Postgres database. For connecting with the psql server i have used a python library named psycopg2. With the help of that i have made connection and cursor which were used throughout the script to access database objects and perform queries.

All the data from the three tables was completely transferred to the database and ERD of the sample database was also made using PgAdmin ERD tool. The snasphsots of the data being shown in three different platforms has been provided under.
